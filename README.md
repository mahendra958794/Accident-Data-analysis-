AccidentDB – Traffic Accident Data Analysis 

Shaping Future India

 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data across Indian States, Union Territories (UTs), and Cities to understand accident patterns, fatalities, injuries, and regional risk levels.
The analysis aims to identify high-risk regions, detect data anomalies, and support data-driven road safety decisions.

 Objectives

Analyze traffic accidents across States, UTs, and Cities in India

Identify regions with the highest accidents and fatalities

Compare deaths vs injuries to detect anomalies

Classify regions into risk categories (High / Medium / Low)

Support policy-making and road safety improvements

 Dataset Description

The dataset includes accident-related information such as:

Road, railway, and railway crossing accidents

Total accident cases

Total injuries

Total deaths

State-wise, UT-wise, and City-wise records

 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, pyodbc) – Data processing, validation, anomaly detection

SQL Server – Data storage, queries, and analytical calculations

Excel – Data cleaning and validation

Data Visualization – Charts, graphs, and box plots

 Key Insights

Top 5 states account for over 53% of total traffic accidents in India

Tamil Nadu alone contributes ~14.4% of total accidents

Road accidents are the dominant cause across all regions

Metro cities like Chennai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Indore record the highest accidents

Some cities show unrealistic death rates (>100%), flagged as data anomalies

UTs like Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar show very low accident counts

Only Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir exceed the national UT average in traffic deaths

 Analytical Highlights

Box plot analysis revealed extreme outliers in fatalities

States such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra show severe road safety challenges

Cities like Nasik and Varanasi report unusually high fatality ratios

Added a computed Death_Rate column to identify cities with severe accidents

Regions classified into risk categories for targeted safety measures

 Solutions & Recommendations

Improve road infrastructure in high-risk states and cities

Enforce stricter traffic laws and speed regulations

Strengthen emergency response and medical services

Run public awareness and road safety campaigns

Focus railway safety on track maintenance rather than crossings alone

 Conclusion

This project presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of traffic accidents in India.
By combining SQL, Python, Excel, and visual analytics, the study:

Identifies accident hotspots and critical regions

Detects data inconsistencies without losing valuable information

Provides actionable insights for policymakers and safety authorities

Overall, the project demonstrates how analytics can play a crucial role in reducing traffic fatalities and improving public safety.
